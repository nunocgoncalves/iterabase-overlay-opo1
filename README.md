# iterabase-overlay

The **product base overlay repo** for the Iterabase platform — the upstream template each client deployment forks. Part of the forge overlay system (HOR-341).

> **Status:** minimal scaffold (HOR-341). The `pi/` tool library is deferred to HOR-351; the real opinionated deployment recipe + CRD instances land per-deployment (e.g. OPO1, HOR-299).

## What this is

Iterabase is **per-customer, fully isolated, self-hosted**. Each engagement installs a complete platform stack on the customer's infra. The deployment-specific configuration — Helm values + CRD instances — lives in an **overlay repo** that `forge apply --overlay` consumes. This repo (`iterabase-overlay`) is the **upstream template** every client overlay forks.

The fork model (Horizonshift Platform Direction §5):

- **Base repo (this repo)** = the product template: base Helm values + base CRD instances, versioned with the platform.
- **Client overlay repo = a fork** of this repo. Client-specific config lives in client-owned paths (no merge conflicts on upstream sync).
- **Clients opt in to product updates** by syncing their fork with upstream (`git merge`/`rebase`). Pushes to this base repo have **no effect** on client infra until the client syncs. Clients can **pin to a tag** for stability.
- **No base+client merge at apply time** — the "merge" is a git-level fork sync, client-initiated. `forge apply --overlay` takes ONE input (the client fork, self-contained).
- **Flux** (HOR-292, target architecture) watches the **client fork only** → push-to-Git auto-reconcile. Base-repo pushes don't trigger reconciliation.

## Repo structure

```
iterabase-overlay/
├── README.md              # this file (the fork-model design doc)
├── values.yaml            # base Helm values (deployment-recipe layer over the iterabase-platform chart defaults)
├── values.client.yaml     # client Helm value overrides (empty in base; clients fill their fork)
└── crds/
    ├── base/              # product base CRD INSTANCES (clients never edit — keeps upstream syncs clean)
    │   └── kustomization.yaml
    └── client/            # client CRD instances + supersede patches (client-owned; no sync conflict)
        └── kustomization.yaml   # resources: [../base] + client files; patches: overrides
```

**CRD instances, not definitions.** The CRD *definitions* (the schemas for `Model`, `ModelBackend`, `PermissionPolicy`, `IdentityMapping`) ship with the control-plane Helm chart. This overlay carries **instances** (resources of those kinds). `forge apply` installs the chart first, then `kubectl apply -k crds/client/`, so the kinds exist before instances are applied.

**Kustomize base/overlay mirrors the git fork model.** `crds/base/` is the upstream product instances (inherited via the fork); `crds/client/` composes `../base` and adds client instances + patches. This is Flux-native: HOR-292 points a Flux `Kustomization` at `crds/client/` for continuous reconciliation, with zero restructure.

## Supersede, not edit

Clients **never edit** `crds/base/` or `values.yaml` — that would cause merge conflicts on upstream sync. Instead:

- **Helm values:** put overrides in `values.client.yaml`. `forge apply` runs `helm -f values.yaml -f values.client.yaml` (later file wins).
- **CRD instances:** add client instances in `crds/client/` (client-owned filenames). To **supersede** a base instance, add a kustomize **patch** in `crds/client/kustomization.yaml` with the same identity (name); the patch overrides the base instance.

## Forking + syncing

1. **Fork** this repo to the client's Git host (e.g. `github.com/<client>/iterabase-overlay`).
2. **Add upstream** (one-time):
   ```sh
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/nunocgoncalves/iterabase-overlay.git
   ```
3. **Sync** with product updates (client-initiated; base pushes have no effect until you sync):
   ```sh
   git fetch upstream
   git merge upstream/master   # or: git rebase upstream/master
   ```
   Because client config lives in `values.client.yaml` + `crds/client/` (dedicated paths), upstream syncs rarely conflict.
4. **Pin for stability** (optional): set `overlay.ref` to a tag instead of `master`. Tags are cut with platform releases (first tag `v0.1.0` lands in HOR-299).

## `forge apply --overlay`

```sh
forge apply --overlay https://github.com/<client>/iterabase-overlay.git
```

`forge apply` clones the client fork on the host, then:

1. `helm upgrade --install <release> <iterabase-platform-chart> -f values.yaml -f values.client.yaml`
2. `kubectl apply -k crds/client/` (after the chart, so CRD kinds exist)

`forge apply` is idempotent (re-clones to the current ref each run; `helm upgrade --install` + `kubectl apply -k` are idempotent). Private repos: `forge` prompts for a token (non-echo, scope-checked) or reads `FORGE_OVERLAY_TOKEN`.

## `pi/` tool library — deferred

The `pi/` tree (`pi/product/` + `pi/client/`, the pi extensions + skills mounted into AgentSandboxes) is **not in this scaffold** — it lands with the pi harness (HOR-351). The fork-model rules above (supersede-not-edit, client-owned paths) will extend to `pi/product` vs `pi/client` when it arrives. forge does not materialize `pi/`; the harness/operator fetches it (continuous sync via Flux `source-controller`, HOR-292).
